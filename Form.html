    <!--As with other pages, the text here is just silliness. Below is the form as required by the assignment- I've also included a range data type response, which was fun to research. 
        I also decided to include the required images inside this form. -->
    <p id="uncenteredParagraph">This room is mostly dark, save for a single torch on a stand blazing in front of you. All around is darkness. You can feel that the room must be quite expansive by the gentle breeze that flows by you and the echoing sounds of your footsteps.
    Next to the torch is a table, with a small piece of paper on it. Picking up the paper, you read:
