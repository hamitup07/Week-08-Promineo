<!-- This is the home page. I've taken inspiration from an MDN page about using the <nav> tag to imbed links to the other pages within a paragraph of text, but I've also included the navigation links in a standard <div>.-->
    
    <h1>Home</h1>
    <div class="navigationBar">
        <a href="Contact.html">Contact</a>
        <a href="Information.html">Information</a>
        <a href="form.html">Form Submission</a> 
    </div>

    <br>
    <nav>
        <p id="uncenteredParagraph"> 
            Welcome to the Home Page. Imagine yourself standing in a quiet room. <br>
            In front of you lie three doors: the first is labeled <a href="Contact.html">"Contact,"</a> though no further context is given. <br>
            The second reads <a href="Information.html">"Information,"</a> and looks mind-numbingly dull. <br>
            The third is adorned in jewels and gold inlay, and written in flowing silver script are the words <a href="form.html">"Form Submission."</a> <br>
            Scattered about the room is a selection of furniature with very pedestrian taste, complete with tacky magazines. <br>
            There seems no point in staying here. Why not choose one of the doors?
        </p>
